            <article class="post-content">
                <p><strong>This whole journey started with helping my father with financial documents.</strong> He sent me photos (HEIC files) that needed to become a single, merged PDF file. A very easy task, right? I looked at the popular sites everyone recommends: Free Convert, PDF Candy, etc. And then I paused, and in my mind I imagined.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    “How the actual hell do people trust these sites with sensitive files? Its closed source, with no privacy promises at all”
                </blockquote>

                <p>Those forms held <em>extremely personal</em> information, information that could be used for malicious intent if exposed. The more I looked at these PDF websites, the more uneasy I felt. All of these tools were closed source. Privacy promises were vague. Some required holding your emails and payment information to use. I myself couldn’t verify what actually happened to my files, and that was unacceptable.</p>

                <p>So I called a friend who shared the same exact problems as me. We decided to build the PDF WebApp we wished existed, which we named gPDF.</p>

                <p> We chose the name gPDF because we value transparency, clarity (like light), and we value giving people a premium, refined PDF experience they won't find anywhere else.
                </p>

                <p>gPDF's main differentiator is that you didn't need to trust what we say, you can check you code yourself in our repository. Our core values align with an old Russian proverb:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Trust, but verify"
                </blockquote>

                <p>From day one, we chose to be different, not by cramming in every feature possible, but by committing to a few non‑negotiables:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privacy‑first.</strong> We design features with 100% confidentiality in mind and avoid unnecessary data collection wherever possible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Open source.</strong> Every code we write is public, transparency you can verify, not just trust. <a href="https://github.com/neurici" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the repo</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Free. Really, truly Free.</strong> No freemium model, no paywalls, no watermarks, no trials, no limited usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple, not over-bloated.</strong> Do the simple things better than everyone else, not focusing on adding every feature humanely possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>A very important aspect of gPDF, is that: privacy isn’t a feature. It’s the foundation.</p>

                <p>If you’ve ever hesitated to upload a document because it felt risky, you’re not alone, not even a little. We literally built gPDF for that exact reason.</p>

                <p><strong>Try the tools</strong> on our homepage, or audit the code yourself on <a href="https://github.com/neurici" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. Your documents deserve respect.</p>
                
                <hr>

                <h2>Everyone talks about what they will do, but what are some things we won't do developing gPDF?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No silent uploads:</strong> None of our tools will ever be server-side. We won’t move your files anywhere.</li>
                    <li><strong>No data selling. Ever:</strong> The only possible data we collect are through Plausible.io and BuyMeACoffee.</li>
                    <li><strong>No features held hostage:</strong> You will never pay a premium, or be forced to sign up to use any feature.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Ok it sounds great and all but, how do you guys plan to make money? What is your motive?</h2>
                <p>gPDF might sound way too good to be true, I mean, what's in it for us? Well, a couple of things.
                    For one, we're in a college, and college means we're looking for jobs and other opportunities. We're hoping that 
                    gPDF could be an amazing tool to add to our resumes. It's a win/win situation, because it means that gPDF is 
                    a tool you guys can use to make your lives easier, and a tool that we can use to make our resumes look better.
                </p>

                <p>But seriously, for funding. If you genuinely enjoy what our message is, or enjoy our tools, absolutely feel free to share 
                    gPDF with others, maybe fork your own version and improve on our design to contribute to our project.
