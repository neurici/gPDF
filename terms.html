                    <p><strong>Effective Date: December 25, 2025</strong></p>

                    <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
                    <p>By accessing or using the gPDF website in any way, including browsing the website, using any tools, or interacting with any content, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions, do not use this Service.</p>

                    <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
                    <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in your jurisdiction) to use this Service. If you are under 18, you may only use the Service under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by these Terms.</p>

                    <h3>3. Description of Service</h3>
                    <p>gPDF provides a free, unlimited, and registration-free suite of tools for converting and modifying PDF files. All processing is done on the client-side, meaning your files are never uploaded to our servers. For detailed information on how we handle your data, please refer to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                    <h3>3. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
                    <p>The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, computer code (including source code, which is open for review), products, software, services, and all other elements of the gPDF website (the “Materials”) are protected by copyright, trade dress, patent, and trademark laws, international conventions, and all other relevant intellectual property and proprietary rights. The gPDF name, logo, and branding are the exclusive property of the site owners. Your use of the service does not grant you ownership of any of the Materials.</p>

                    <h3>4. Content Ownership</h3>
                    <p>gPDF does not claim any ownership over the files you upload, edit, or convert. You retain all intellectual property rights and any other rights to your content. You are solely responsible for the content you process through our Service.</p>

                    <h3>5. User Conduct</h3>
                    <p>You agree not to use the service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You are solely responsible for the files you create, edit, or convert using our tools. You agree not to use gPDF to process any material that is unlawful, offensive, or otherwise objectionable.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, you agree not to use any automated system, including “bots,” to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</p>

                    <h3>6. Third-Party Services</h3>
                    <p>Our website uses third-party services for monetization, including Buy Me a Coffee & Plausible.io. gPDF is not responsible for the content, policies, or practices of these third-party services, and your interactions with them are solely between you and the third party. Your use of third-party services is governed by their respective terms and privacy policies.</p>

                    <h3>6. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h3>
                    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE AND YOUR USE THEREOF.</p>
                    <p>WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT, LOST REVENUE, OR LOSS OF DATA, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE. BECAUSE ALL FILE PROCESSING IS HANDLED ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE (CLIENT-SIDE), YOU BEAR THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DATA LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF YOUR FILES.</p>

                    <h3>8. Bug Reporting</h3>
                    <p>While we are not liable for issues arising from the use of our service, we are committed to improving it. Users have the right to report any bugs or issues by contacting us at: neurici@gmail.com. Submission of a bug report does not create any obligation on gPDF to take action, provide a response, or implement a fix.</p>

                    <h3>9. Changes to Service and Terms</h3>
                    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time without prior notice. We also reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. If we make material changes to these Terms, we will attempt to notify users by posting a notice on the site for a reasonable period. Your continued use of the site after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.</p>

                    <h3>10. Governing Law</h3>
                    <p>These Terms of Service and your use of the website are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction.</p>
